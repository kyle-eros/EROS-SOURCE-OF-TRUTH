# BigQuery Project "of-scheduler-proj" - Full Audit & Overview

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive audit of the BigQuery project `of-scheduler-proj`. The project is a sophisticated, enterprise-grade data platform for OnlyFans content scheduling and revenue optimization. It is currently in a critical transitional phase, migrating from a legacy monolithic system to a modern, 7-layer "Lakehouse" architecture.

**Key Findings:**
- **Advanced Architecture:** The new architecture is well-designed, following modern data engineering best practices.
- **Sophisticated ML:** The project leverages a state-of-the-art Machine Learning system for caption recommendations, featuring a multi-armed bandit approach, A/B testing capabilities, and dynamic configuration.
- **Operational Excellence:** The new system includes robust operational datasets for monitoring, configuration, and auditing (`ops_*` datasets).
- **Migration Risk:** The most significant finding is the ongoing migration. **Crucially, all 12 scheduled queries are currently disabled**, meaning the new ETL pipelines and ML models are not running automatically. This is a major risk and should be the highest priority to resolve.

This audit will detail the legacy and new systems, analyze the ML architecture, and provide actionable recommendations.

## 2. System Architecture Analysis

The project currently consists of two parallel systems: a legacy system that is being deprecated and a new, modern data architecture that is production-ready but not fully operational.

### 2.1. New Migrated Architecture (The Future)

The new architecture is a well-structured 7-layer data lakehouse, which provides clear separation of concerns and enables scalability and data governance.

- **Layer 01: Raw:** Raw data ingestion (currently unused, data flows via staging).
- **Layer 02: Staging:** Data cleansing, validation, and standardization.
- **Layer 03: Foundation:** Core business entities (facts and dimensions).
- **Layer 04: Semantic:** Business-specific logic and aggregated metrics.
- **Layer 05: ML:** The feature store for the machine learning models.
- **Layer 06: Analytics:** (Planned) For advanced analytics and reporting.
- **Layer 07: Export:** API-ready data views for external consumption (e.g., Google Apps Script).

**Key Datasets:** `layer_01_raw`, `layer_02_staging`, `layer_03_foundation`, `layer_04_semantic`, `layer_05_ml`, `layer_06_analytics`, `layer_07_export`.

### 2.2. Legacy System (The Past)

The legacy system appears to be a more monolithic structure where data from various sources was processed and stored in a few key datasets.

- **`raw`:** The original raw data storage.
- **`staging`:** The original staging area for ETL processes.
- **`core`:** The heart of the legacy system, containing original business logic, fact tables, and dimension tables.
- **`mart`:** A hybrid dataset that serves as the primary reporting layer, used by both legacy and new systems. It is business-critical but relies on a mix of new and old data structures.

**Key Datasets:** `raw`, `staging`, `core`, `mart`.

## 3. Machine Learning System Audit

The ML system is the core of the project's business value, driving intelligent caption scheduling.

- **Objective:** To balance exploration (trying new captions) and exploitation (using proven captions) to maximize revenue per send (RPS).
- **Algorithm:** It uses a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) approach with Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) for exploration and an epsilon-greedy mechanism.
- **Feature Store (`layer_05_ml.feature_store`):** This is the heart of the ML system, containing 166 engineered features for each caption, including:
    - Performance metrics (RPS, confidence scores)
    - Temporal patterns (best hour/day)
    - Cooldown features (to prevent audience fatigue)
    - Exploration scores (UCB bonuses)
- **Configuration (`ops_config.ml_parameters`):** The ML model is highly configurable through a JSON-based table, allowing for dynamic adjustments to weights, exploration parameters, and business rules without code changes. This includes an A/B testing framework.

**Assessment:** This is a sophisticated and well-designed ML system that goes beyond simple recommendations to create a self-learning and optimizable scheduling engine.

## 4. Operational Audit

### 4.1. ETL and Scheduled Queries

The project is designed to be highly automated through a series of scheduled queries that manage the entire data lifecycle.

- **Gmail ETL Pipeline:** Ingests data from Gmail reports.
- **ML Feature Refresh:** Rebuilds the feature store daily.
- **Caption Rankings:** Generates new recommendations hourly.

**CRITICAL FINDING:** According to `BIGQUERY_OVERVIEW.md`, all 12 scheduled queries for the project are **DISABLED** pending migration completion. This means:
- No new data is being ingested or processed by the new architecture.
- The ML models are not being updated.
- The `mart` and `layer_07_export` datasets are likely stale.

### 4.2. Monitoring & Governance

The new architecture includes a suite of `ops_*` datasets for operational excellence:
- **`ops_monitor`:** For real-time monitoring and alerting dashboards.
- **`ops_audit`:** Provides a comprehensive audit trail for compliance and governance.
- **`ops_config`:** Centralized configuration management.

**Assessment:** These operational datasets are a sign of a mature, enterprise-grade platform.

## 5. Key Findings & Actionable Recommendations

### 5.1. Strengths

- **Modern Architecture:** The new 7-layer architecture is a significant improvement, providing scalability, maintainability, and governance.
- **Advanced ML System:** The ML system is state-of-the-art for this application, with a clear focus on revenue optimization and operational flexibility.
- **Excellent Documentation:** The project is well-documented, which was essential for this audit.

### 5.2. Risks & Weaknesses

1.  **CRITICAL - Disabled Scheduled Queries:** The fact that all scheduled queries are disabled is the single biggest risk. The new system is effectively "dark". The business is likely running on stale data or relying on the legacy system.
2.  **Migration Status:** The migration is incomplete. Running two systems in parallel is complex and can lead to data inconsistencies and confusion.
3.  **Complexity:** The sophistication of the system is a strength, but it also presents a challenge for maintenance and onboarding new team members.

### 5.3. Recommendations

1.  **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY - Complete the Migration:**
    - **Validate the New Pipelines:** Manually trigger the ETL and ML refresh scripts (`daily_ml_refresh.sh`) and validate the data at each layer.
    - **Test End-to-End:** Use the test scripts (`test_ml_pipeline.sh`) to ensure the entire system works as expected.
    - **Enable Scheduled Queries:** Once validation is complete, enable the 12 scheduled queries to bring the new architecture to life.

2.  **Decommission Legacy Systems:**
    - Once the new system is fully operational and stable, create a formal plan to decommission the legacy datasets (`raw`, `staging`, `core`).
    - Archive the data in these datasets and then remove them from the project to reduce complexity.

3.  **Update and Maintain Documentation:**
    - The documentation is excellent. Ensure it is updated to reflect the final, fully migrated state of the project.
    - Document the decommissioning of the legacy systems.

4.  **Knowledge Sharing:**
    - Ensure that the team responsible for maintaining this system is fully briefed on the new architecture and the operational procedures.

This audit reveals a project on the cusp of achieving a truly state-of-the-art data platform. The final steps of the migration are critical to realizing its full potential.
